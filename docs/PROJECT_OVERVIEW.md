## 1. Overview
The Venture Pipeline Management System (VPMS) is an MVP developed to help Mekong Inclusive Ventures (MIV) track and manage the progress of early-stage ventures they support.

The system centralises venture-related activities such as document submission, review, and status tracking, providing clear visibility across the venture pipeline from onboarding through to funding readiness.

---

## 2. Goals and Objectives
The primary goal of VPMS is to provide MIV with an easy-to-use and affordable platform to support inclusive ventures without requiring advanced technical expertise.

Key objectives include:
- Centralising venture documentation in one secure location
- Supporting structured review and approval workflows
- Improving visibility of venture progress
- Enforcing role-based access for data security
- Laying the foundation for future enhancements (e.g. analytics, AI support)

---

## 3. Intended Users
- **Founders / Venture Applicants**  
  Upload and manage venture-related documents and track review status.
  
- **MIV Admins / Analysts**  
  Review submissions, approve or reject documents, and manage venture records.
  
- **Internal Developers**  
  Maintain, extend, and deploy the platform.

## 4. Current Scope (MVP)
The current implementation focuses on:
- User authentication and session management
- Secure document upload and storage
- Document categorisation and metadata tracking
- Review workflow (pending, approved, rejected, needs changes)
- Role-based access control

---

## 5. Out of Scope
The following are explicitly outside the scope of the current MVP:
- Enterprise compliance certification (e.g. SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Advanced AI-driven analytics
- Large-scale production performance guarantees
